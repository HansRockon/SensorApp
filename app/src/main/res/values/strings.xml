    <string name="text_motion_sensors">The Android platform provides several sensors that let you monitor the motion of a device. Two of these sensors are always hardware-based (the accelerometer and gyroscope), and three of these sensors can be either hardware-based or software-based (the gravity, linear acceleration, and rotation vector sensors). For example, on some devices the software-based sensors derive their data from the accelerometer and magnetometer, but on other devices they may also use the gyroscope to derive their data. Most Android-powered devices have an accelerometer, and many now include a gyroscope. The availability of the software-based sensors is more variable because they often rely on one or more hardware sensors to derive their data.</string>
    <string name="text_Accelerometer">An acceleration sensor measures the acceleration applied to the device, including the force of gravity.</string>
    <string name="text_Gravity">The gravity sensor provides a three dimensional vector indicating the direction and magnitude of gravity.</string>
    <string name="text_Gyroscope">The gyroscope measures the rate of rotation in rad/s around a device\'s x, y, and z axis.</string>
    <string name="text_Rotation">The rotation vector represents the orientation of the device as a combination of an angle and an axis, in which the device has rotated through an angle Î¸ around an axis (x, y, or z). </string>
